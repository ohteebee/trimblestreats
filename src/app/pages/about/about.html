            We believe in paying it forward and making the world a better and happier place, one tasty treat at a time. That is why we created a marketplace for quality, delectable chocolates at a fair price and continue to pay it forward with every purchase we
            receive. We donate 5% of each and every sale directly to the Big Brothers Big Sisters Organiation, in order to support the important work being done by this organizaiton.
