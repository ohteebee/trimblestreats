        <h1>Shipping</h1>
        <p>

            Your tasty treat will be delivered directly to your door within 7 days of your order, which includes our handling times. In order to keep your candy from melting in transport, we refrigerate each of our treats until the packaging is ready for
            shipment.
        </p>
        <p>

            Each treat is packaged in our handmade and designed boxes. We then wrap that box in mylar wrap to insultate it and add an ice pack if necessary (depending on your local temperature). This process ensures that your tasty treat is delivered to your
            door in the same condition and quality that it left our kitchen in.
